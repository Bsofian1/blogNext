Simple is not easy.

Simple is the opposite of complex or when we face no difficulties.

Making something simple requires time, effort, and a deep understanding of the topic to go from complex to simple. On that journey, we also face a lot of difficulties. 

Easy, on the other hand,  means achieved without great effort or difficulties. 

Using something simple is easy.

Making something simple for others to use with ease is difficult.
