Googly is a robot. His mission is simple: He helps people like you find stories they want to read.
Even if his mission is simple, his work is not easy. Googly works in a library called "Internet" and it's the largest library ever built. Actually, it's even bigger than all libraries assembled together. The Internet has all the books you can imagine, and even more.  
But, nobody is in charge of tidying up the library.  
Imagine walking on the Internet and having books laying on the floor and from the ceiling. Flying books appear and disappear everywhere.   
It's a real mess.  
Fortunately, Googly has 2 superpowers:  
1) He is one of the fastest robots ever built- and he doesn't like to make you wait for your stories.  
2) He doesn't care about the mess. Once he read a book, he will remember the story and where to find it forever.  
Everyday. Googly will go at lightning speed through all the pages, jumping from one book to another. He will read everything in the book and memorize it.   
Sometimes, what's written in a book is confusing for a robot. What humans write for humans doesn't always make sense for a robot. Googly needs help.  
Googly asks Seo, his best friend. Seo is half human, half robot, like a mermaid.  
Her superpower is to understand humans and robots.  
They work together to make sure that Googly understands everything in a book. For example, when there is an image on the book, Googly cannot see it with his robot eyes. Seo describe the image with words so that Googly can understand it.  
The more Googly understands a book, the more stories you can read.
