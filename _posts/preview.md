GPT-3 can write an essay in less than 2 minutes. We prompt an idea and the AI tool will generate a composition of words that explore a topic. Even though it is impressive, I do not believe it is enough. Enough to create work worth sharing with an audience.

Imagine searching the web for an answer, like you might have done today. You open the first website, read the words but it is empty. The second feels the same with different words. The third? you stop reading at the title! Now, you crave authentic and thoughtful content. Writing that solves your problem from a human perspective.

“Average copywriting is now a waste of time” Seth Godin

This is what will happen if we let AI tools do all the work for us. AI tools are great, but they lack the empathy and problem-solving intuition humans' have. 
Writing is not about putting one word after another. Writing is about expressing ourselves and sharing with others. 
If we use AI tools at the right time and for the right purpose, we will push our writing from good to remarkable.

### The difference between good and remarkable.

Remarkable writing is work that stands out. It is writing that people notice and remember.
Good work is the new default. Anyone with access to GPT-3 can generate good work in seconds. Because anyone can do it, it will become the new average.

AI tools will be helpful, but only if we are bringing our human sensitivity to the table.
Let's explore how AI and Humans can collaborate to create remarkable writing. I will share here my process to compose my own articles. 

When working on a new topic, I focus on 2 steps: Find the right idea (1) and express it right (2). 
For each step, I go through 2 phases: creative exploration and laser focus. A fancy way to say divergent and convergent thinking.

## Step 1: Finding the right idea. 
We all get excited and start running around when exploring a new topic. But, to move forward, we need to commit to one direction.

### Explore more directions with AI: Generate a lot of questions. 

You are here, sitting at your desk, the regard lost at the ceiling. The white page of your screen lights up your face until everything gets dark. Your computer went to sleep after 15 min of inactivity. Kicking off creativity is tough, nothing new here. What if you could have someone to talk to, something to spark up your creativity?

AI tools can do that, we prompt something and GPT 3 will generate ideas, questions, or titles. we can generate way more ideas in seconds than in hours of human brainstorming.

Like we would not find all our friends' ideas great, the same applies to GPT-3. Once we have a lot of new tracks, it is time to find the one to explore.

### Focusing on the edges. 

It is time to narrow down our exploration and choose one question. My way is to go for the question I'm the most pressed to answer. The question that teaches me the most and where I take risks.

Questions work best for me, when I see one, I cannot control myself, I need to answer it. 
Once I found my main question, I select the relevant one to build my outline piece by piece.

**Goal step one: Outline creation**

## Step 2: Express it right

Generating content to build up the mass before polishing our final work.

### Put everything down to reach a first draft 

Transfer our thought on paper, without filters, and generate as much content as possible. We aim for quantity here, and AI tools can help us.

We prompt the question we want to ask, GPT-3 takes care of the rest. Another technic is to start a sentence, and the AI will complete it in seconds. It feels like magic.

For this phase, I use custom tools (on top of GPT-3) to generate custom content for me. The software uses sentences and a ton of voice I like and inserts new questions at the end. Then, I copy/paste what I love and delete the rest. Filling out the page is not a problem anymore, but now the real work starts.

### Panning for gold. 

Now that we have a massive piece of concrete, it is time to sculpt it. We have to put in the time and effort to unearth something special. 
We are not afraid to cut big blocks or rewrite a whole paragraph. We are aiming for quality now, less is best.
In this phase, I do not rely much on AI tools anymore. I count on my human sensitivity and empathy to do the work. 
It will take time to dig through all the material gathered so far, but it is worth the effort.

Learnings: 

Creating remarkable work is tough. I understand why so many people are willing to take the GPT-3 shortcut. 
But, It is the price to pay if we want to stand out. And we can now rely on our new AI best friend to amplify our creativity. 

### Questions for you:
How do you use AI tools in the convergence phase?

What is the main point you disagree on?

How will this article impact your writing? Your creative process?
