We should stop focusing on Search Engine Optimization. It is often a short-term solution to a long-term problem. 
Manipulating search engine algorithms will get you to rank higher in search results. But it won't help you build a sustainable business. Instead, we should focus on creating a great digital experience for our customers. It means creating useful content and investing in frictionless user experiences. 
We will reach better traffic quality by delivering more value to our audience over time. Consequences might be getting more backlinks and better ranking in search results.
