Start small but start now. 
Small is not ambitious. Small is not what we dream at night. But small is a first step. 
The advantage is that small doesnâ€™t have to be perfect. All great things in life are built on top of each other. Before being big, it was small.
Focus on the first step. Tomorrow, we will focus on the next one. 

But start now.
