### Before playing with AI tools.

AI tools are not magic, but close! 
Today, they are storming your newsfeeds; for a reason, they are remarkable. You might have run into people telling you how they use AI tools to generate imaginative work in no time. Here is a short selection of my favorites.

When I saw those, my first impression was that anyone accessing AI tools could create creative work in minutes. Imagine having an idea and being able to share it without any design skills, pretty cool!

My reality is more complicated. Having no knowledge of graphic composition, I struggle to create great outputs. Most of my attempts ended up being stock-picture-like. [Illustration 3]

Do you have an idea you want to try? here is a playground to test it: [Link to playground]

What is the difference between us and them? 
What makes us create stock pictures like visuals when they can create beautiful art. 
Those AI creators have been working on their craft, for a long time, over and over again. With new AI tools, it becomes straightforward to go from their creative ideas to the final work. Let's see what they do differently from us. 
A clear idea to share
When making new visuals with AI tools, I'm more focused on testing the tools than making my ideas come to life. Generally, I start with a random idea:
"A nice picture of a house". And I get average house results.
Then, I explore some directions but do not deepen them far enough.
"A nice picture of a house from the '50s".
"A nice picture of a house from the '50s in color".
The results are not good, not as good as on Twitter.

AI creators have a clear idea of the output they aim for. They play with artistic elements to make their outputs stronger. They don't quit before they reach their goal.

I had a chance to exchange with Davy, a colleague at Ginetta. He told me the following, " idea of the output I want. It helps me to have a creative direction, then, I can apply specificity like dimension, style, color..."

So, the first challenge to overcome is to have a clear idea of what you want. Once you have it, we just need to be specific enough to make it come to life.

Without education in art and design, expressing those specificities is challenging for me. How could I know about "photographer styles" or "contrasting levels"? Let's see what else those AI creators do better. 
Remarkable skillset
To illustrate this blog post, I thought about using some AI-Human futuristic superheroes.

In my mind, I thought about a cyborg person in a Cyberpunk environment.
My prompt: "Cyberpunk warrior digital painting"
Jo√£o Carrapato prompt: "cyberpunk warrior, sewers, toon, Calder Moore, baka art, anime, dark, green, acrylic palette knife, highly detailed digital painting, elegant"

I guess you already spotted the difference? They are specific on what they want and let the AI do what it does best, a unique composition from the best of the internet.
Those specificities are easy to copy, you can copy/paste the prompt from someone else. On playgroundai, you even have a button to do just that. 

Building an original idea and prompting it from scratch requires another skill set level. In addition to your creative skills, you need to express what the AI can understand. 
Conclusion
AI tools are great and they are here to stay. It is interesting to realize how much the tools are just tools, like Photoshop. Creators and artists are the ones making their ideas come to life through their remarkable skills and passions. And the one that will continue to surprise us in the future.
They aren't magicians after all.
