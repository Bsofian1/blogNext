What we do is essential. But if we don’t share it with others, what we do might be unnoticed. 

Sometimes, it’s okay, we don’t want other people to notice. 

In most cases, it’s essential to be noticed. Sharing our work with others becomes as crucial as what we do.

The quality and effort you put into what you do must be reflected when you share it. Poor sharing will lead to a poor perception of your work. 

What we do and what we share become one.
